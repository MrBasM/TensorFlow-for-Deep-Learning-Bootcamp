# 🧠 TensorFlow for Deep Learning Bootcamp – Colab Notebooks

Welcome to my personal repository for all Colab notebooks I create while following the **TensorFlow for Deep Learning Bootcamp** by Zero to Mastery.

## 🎯 Goal

This repository serves as a learning log and reference point for my journey through deep learning with TensorFlow 2.x. It includes hands-on notebooks covering:

- TensorFlow fundamentals
- Neural networks with Keras
- Computer vision & CNNs
- NLP & RNNs
- Transfer learning
- Time series forecasting
- and more...

Each notebook is designed to be self-contained, runnable on [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/), and includes both code and explanations.

## 📁 Folder Structure

```
.
├── 00_tensorflow_fundamentals.ipynb
├── 01_neural_network_regression_with_tensorflow_video.ipynb
├── ...
└── README.md
```

> 🔁 Notebooks are named using a prefix (`00_`, `01_`, etc.) to keep them in logical order according to the course progression.

## 🛠️ Requirements

All notebooks are built to run in **Google Colab**, so you don’t need to install anything locally. If you'd like to run them locally, make sure to install:

```bash
pip install tensorflow matplotlib pandas scikit-learn
```

## 🚀 About the Bootcamp

This bootcamp is part of the **Zero to Mastery Academy**, led by [Daniel Bourke](https://github.com/mrdbourke), and aims to provide a practical and modern understanding of deep learning using TensorFlow and Keras.

## 📌 Notes

- This repo is for **educational purposes** only.
- All notebooks are based on course materials, extended with my own notes and experiments.
- Feedback, ideas, or pull requests are welcome!
