# 🧠 TensorFlow for Deep Learning Bootcamp – Colab Notebooks

Welcome to my personal repository for all Colab notebooks I create while following the **TensorFlow for Deep Learning Bootcamp** by Zero to Mastery.

## 🎯 Goal

This repository serves as a learning log and reference point for my journey through deep learning with TensorFlow 2.x. It includes hands-on notebooks covering:

- TensorFlow fundamentals
- Neural networks with Keras
- Computer vision & CNNs
- NLP & RNNs
- Transfer learning
- Time series forecasting
- and more...

Each notebook is designed to be self-contained, runnable on [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/), and includes both code and explanations.
